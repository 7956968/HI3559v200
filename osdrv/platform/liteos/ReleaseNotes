-----------

New Features
The following are some new features with this release.

Bug Fixes
The following are some bug Fixes with this release.

    * compat:
      - Fixed the bug of message queue. 1. when we call the mq_receive and mq_timedreceive, will pass out the data's memory address,but the other task can write over new data into this address after then, so the user may get the wrong data using the address getted before. 2. when we call the mq_receive and mq_timedreceive, the return value is the real-size store in the queue,but the LOS_QueueReadCopy function does not support return the read size,so this size is calculated after call the LOS_QueueReadCopy function, as the same reason, the size stored in the queue is also not save.
      - Fixed the bug of pthread_join which the multi-thread joining with one-thread will be block(pended) not release the resources in addition to the first joining thread. 1 In multi-thread joining one-thread case,only the first joining thread return to the correct value 0,other joining thread return to EVAIL. 2 Added corresponding test cases apply

    * kernel:
      - Fixed Fixed the bug of message queue. 1. when we call the LOS_QueueReadCopy, will pass out the data's memory address, but the other task can write over new data into this address after then, so the user may get the wrong data using the address getted before. 2. the LOS_QueueReadCopy function does not support return the read size, but we need the real-size, so change the paramer of the function.

Known Issues
The following are some known issues with this release.

    * kernel:
      - cpu usage:  The mechanism of cpu usage is different from Linux.

    * fs:
      - yaffs: ylib, a cache between nand driver and yaffs, is turned off by default in this release.
      This is a tradeoff between access speed and nand flash lifetime. Turning on ylib may decrease nand
      flash lifetime because ylib will erase more frequently due to cache update. Add macro
      CONFIG_FS_YAFFS_CACHE to turn on ylib.
